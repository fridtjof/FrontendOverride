# FrontendOverride

Currently, only Underground 2 is supported. Support for more games will follow at some point.

## Usage
(This mod is intended for use with ThirteenAG's [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader))
- Drop this into your scripts/plugins directory
- Create a subdirectory "fngs" next to it, and drop in any .fng files.
  - both raw .fng data (starting with 'FEn') and data wrapped in a 0x30203 bChunk is supported.
